# Geomagnetic Storm May 2024

## Overview

To enhance public understanding of space weather and its effects on Earth, the Moon, and Mars, we have created a visual representation of the May 2024 geomagnetic storm and developed a comprehensive website. This platform features:

- **Visual Graphics**: Illustrating the May 2024 geomagnetic storm and its effects on Earth, the Moon, and Mars.
- **Detailed Information**: Providing insights into the storm's impact from various celestial perspectives.
- **Interactive Playground**: Enabling users to explore the solar system, planets, and other celestial bodies.
- **Storm Forecast**: Offering real-time updates on previous and upcoming geomagnetic storms.

Despite challenges such as limited resources, our team remains committed to improving the websiteâ€™s user experience and expanding its educational content. This initiative aims to raise public awareness of cosmic events like geomagnetic storms and their far-reaching implications.
